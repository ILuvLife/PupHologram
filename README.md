# PupHologram

This is a dll that Pinup Popper can call when selecting a pinball table. This will then make the calls to PlayHologramFiles to tell the led hologram fan to play a video defined for that pinball table.

To use this will require changes made to PupMenuScript.pup in sections of code that are not meant to be changed.
